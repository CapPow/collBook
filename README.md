# Modernizing Field Collection Techniques

collBook, is the desktop counterpart for the mobile app collNote. Combined they are a field-to-database solution designed for field biologists to gather and format “born digital” field notes into database ready formats. A mobile application, collNote is being developed for Android and iOS devices to gather Darwin Core formatted field notes. A desktop application, collBook is being developed for Linux, OS X, and Windows to refine those field notes into portal ready Darwin Core files and specimen labels. Field note refinements include: reverse geocoding localities, taxonomic alignments, and creation of customizable labels which can optionally include catalog number barcodes.

## Development Stage

collBook is in an early testing stage. Unexpected crashes are expected to be frequent, so please take caution with your data and work on copies. Pull requests are welcomed!

#### Known bugs
- Preview window zoom is not properly updated at start up. For now, altering the zoom after start up solves this.
